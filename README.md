# TheDecisionMaker
This is a "What to do" program. It is meant to help the user decide what they should do if they are bored and have free time.
It meets this goal in 2 ways:
1.  Allows the user to input their own activities/interest and helps them either pick what to do at random or narrow down their decision.
2.  Provides the user with a catelog of options to choose from; these are broken into categories and each category provides numerous options to select from that are unique to that category.
